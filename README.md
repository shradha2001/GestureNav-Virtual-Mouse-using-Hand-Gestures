# GestureNav-Virtual-Mouse-using-Hand-Gestures
A virtual mouse using hand gestures is a technology that enables users to control a computer or digital device through physical movements of their hands, rather than using a traditional mouse or touchpad. This system typically relies on computer vision or sensors to track hand movements and interpret them as mouse actions.
